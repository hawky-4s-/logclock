Homework 4

Implement logical clocks in Erlang!
• Use at least 4 Erlang processes.
• Each process shall have its own logical clock.
• Each logical clock shall have its own increment (in the same way as in assignment 1). • Each process shall randomly send an arbitrary message to another random process.
• Adjust the clocks if necessary.
What did you gain by using logical clocks? Run your program a reasonable period of time and show which states can actually be ordered.


Homework 5

Adjust your previous Erlang program to use vector clocks!
Again: What did you gain by using vector clocks? Run your program a reasonable period of time and show which states can actually be ordered.
